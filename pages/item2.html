                        <dd>- Before play begins, you must arrange your ships on your primary grid.
                        <dd>- Each ship occupies a number of consecutive squares on the grid, arranged either
                            horizontally
                            or vertically. </dd>
                        <dd>- The number of squares for each ship is determined by the type of ship. </dd>
                        <dd>- The ships cannot overlap and the types and numbers of ships allowed are the same for each
                            player. </dd>

                        <dd>- If all of a player's ships have been sunk, the game is over and their opponent wins. If
                            all ships of both players are sunk by the end of the round, the game is a draw.</dd>
