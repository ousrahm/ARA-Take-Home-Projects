        <h5>I feel very passionately about the computer science community. </h5>
        <p>
            Throughout my time in the computer science field, I have utilized many parts of the community for resources,
            tools, and solutions to problems. It has enabled me to learn new techniques, develop my skills, complete
            projects on time, and provide assistance to other developers.<br><br>
            One part of the community that is so inviting is the willingness to share knowledge. Through open-sourced
            tools, extensive documentation, and free-to-use forums, developers help the entire community improve their
            skills and intelligence. Without the involvement of the users and creators of computer science tools, the
            digital age would be much more difficult to navigate and much less accessible. This is a result of another
            aspect that makes me love the computer science community: how many avid learners there are. As someone who
            learns new things every day, I appreciate the huge portion of the industry that values gaining knowledge and
            makes it easier for the next person to gain it as well, especially in an industry that will never stop
            developing and changing. <br><br>
            The fact that the technological world changes so rapidly highlights another aspect that makes the computer
            science community such a pleasure to be a part of: it values skills more than knowledge. Valuing the ability
            to learn and the skill of solving promotes the search of knowledge. This is reflected in the industry, which
            enables developers to tackle projects in a wide variety of languages and frameworks. As a computer scientist
            who loves to solve problems, I have found that the techniques one uses to solve a problem and learn along
            the way are extremely important and are skills in and of themselves. While the focus may be on creating
            solutions, the processes are ultimately more valuable as they facilitate easier, better solutions.<br><br>
            A way that I could contribute to our community in the future would be to create a site that acts like a
            search engine and hub for documentation, tools, and resources. An issue with resources like StackOverflow is
            that it can be difficult at times to find exactly what you are looking for while staying within the realm of
            tools and resources that you are utilizing. An issue with using search engines like Google is in the wide
            breath of the search results, most of which are likely not relevant. To solve both of these issues while
            maintaining ease-of-use, the site would have many different features. It would implore the user to be as
            specific as possible through a series of fields that will make the search results more accurate. Limited to
            only relevant, validated sites, the search results would contain documentation, tutorials, and tools that
            could aid in the finding of a solution. While this is currently just an idea, the computer science community
            deserves as many resources as it can get to simplify developerâ€™s lives and enhance their learning abilities.
